                            <p>The advancement of the tech industry in Nigeria has made a significant contribution to
                                the development of the Nigerian economy. According to the 2022 Q2 GDP report by the
                                National Bureau of Statistics, the tech industry has surpassed the oil sector by
                                contributing 18.66% to the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). This massive growth
                                started in 2020 when the industry contributed 15 percent to the country’s GDP. <a
                                    href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/540559-fintechs-got-63-of-total-funds-raised-by-nigerian-start-ups-in-2021-association.html">In
                                    2021,
                                    Nigerian start-ups raised 1.37 billion dollars of the four billion dollars raised by
                                    startups in Africa.</a> However, this immense development added to the growing call
                                to
                                regulate this sector by providing a legal and institutional framework to eradicate the
                                legal hurdles that have trailed the tech startup industry in the past years. To address
                                these complexities and bridge the interaction gap between startups and regulators, the
                                Nigeria Startup Bill draft was created in 2021. The bill was recently approved in July
                                2022 by the Nigerian Senate and is currently at the House of Representatives to pass
                                through the third reading. If the House of Representatives approves the Bill, the Bill
                                will be sent to the President for his assent and will thus become law. Below is a
                                breakdown of some major provisions in the Startup Bill.</p>
                            <p><b>MAJOR PROVISIONS IN THE NIGERIA STARTUP BILL</b></p>

                            <p>1. Establishment of an Institutional Framework

                                enhance the development of digital technology and provide an enabling environment for
                                startups, investors, incubators, and accelerators in Nigeria.</p>

                            <p>2. Establishment of the Secretariat of the Council
                                The Secretariat of the Council has a vital role in the realization of the intent of the
                                Bill and in settling an enabling environment for startups in Nigeria. The Bill
                                establishes the Secretariat of the Council, and the Nigeria Information Technology

                                support.</li>
                            </p>

                            <p><b>3. Establishment of Startup Support and Engagement Portal</b>
                                The Startup Support and Engagement Portal (“the portal”) shall be a public online
                                platform to provide access to information on matters pertaining to the establishment,
                                development, and labeling of a startup; incubation and acceleration programmes; and
                                facilitating and providing startups with access to angel investors and VCs through
                                collaboration with the federal government. Furthermore, the portal shall facilitate
                                access to federal government incentives and grants; fiscal and non-fiscal support; and
                                several other opportunities.</p>

                                For ease of collaboration and partnership among industry stakeholders within the
                                Nigerian tech startup ecosystem, the Bill provides for the creation of a startup forum
                                by the Secretariat subject to the approval of the Council. The Forum shall be a
                                consultative body to be set up on the Startup portal to provide information sharing on
                                available local capabilities, companies that qualify to be labeled as a startup,
                                relevant incentives that apply to a startup, and policy proposals that may be relevant
                                to the Nigerian startup ecosystem.
                                The Forum shall consist of industry stakeholders and representatives registered on the
                                Startup Portal.</p>
                            <p>5. Labelling of a Startup
                                The Bill defined a startup as a company in existence for not more than 10 years, with
                                its objectives being the creation, innovation, production, development, or adoption of a
                                unique digital technology innovative product, service, or process. This means that a
                                limited liability tech company registered under CAMA that has been in existence for a
                                period of not more than 10 years with an objective to innovate, develop, produce,
                                improve, and commercialize innovative products or processes can apply for a startup
                                label. In addition to the eligibility for grant of a startup label, there must be at
                                least one Nigerian as a founder or Co-founder of the startup, provided that the Nigerian
                                founder or co-founder will share from profit or revenue from the sale of shares. A
                                qualified startup will be issued a labeling certificate by the Secretariat and the
                                startup label shall be valid for 10 years from the date of issuance.</p>
                            <p><b>Benefits of a labeled Startup.</b></p>

                            <p>f. A labelled startup shall benefit from fast-track procedure on any transactions,
                                registration or obtaining of licenses from regulators like Securities and Exchange

                                Acquisition and Promotion (NOTAP), Nigerian Copyright Commission and the Trademarks,

                                place by the Secretariat through collaborations with the aforementioned regulators.</p>
                            <p><b>6. Establishment of Startup Investment seed Fund</b>
                                The Bill provides for the establishment of the Startup Investment Seed fund (“the Fund”)
                                which is to be managed by the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority. The Fund shall
                                apply to labeled startups, technology laboratories, accelerators, incubators, and hubs.
                                This seed Fund will enable access to finance and tech relief for startups to easily grow
                                their business, thereby making it easy for startups to fund their operations by
                                leveraging on grants and loans to be made available to them.

                            </p>
                            <p><b>7. Training, Capacity Building, and Talent Development</b>
                                The Bill introduces training and capacity-building programmes for tech startups. This
                                will enable startups and their employees to have access to trainings facilitated by the
                                Industrial Training Fund and any organization that partners with the Secretariat. In
                                addition, the Bill provides for Talent Development and Academic Research Institutions’

                                Polytechnics within Nigeria to develop modules, programmes, and hold workshops. The
                                implication of this is that startups and their employees will have access to educational
                                programs that will empower them with the right skill set and enhance their
                                competitiveness in the Tech Ecosystem.

                            </p>
                            <p><b>8. Tax and Fiscal Incentives</b>

                            <p>e. An eligible employee of a labeled startup shall be entitled to a personal income tax
                                exemption of 35% on the income of the employee for a period of two years from the date
                                of engagement by a labeled startup.</p>
                            <p><b>9. Support with Regulators.</b>
                                The bill enhances regulatory support for startups. It provides for collaboration with
                                regulatory bodies to facilitate seamless processes for labelled startups. A labelled
                                startup shall benefit from fast-track procedures on any transactions, registrations, or
                                obtaining of licenses from regulatory bodies like SEC, CAC, NOTAP, Nigerian Copyright
                                Commission, and the Trademarks, Patent, and Design Registries. This fast-track procedure
                                will be implemented by the Secretariat in collaboration with the aforementioned
                                regulators.

                            </p>
                            <p><b>10. Establishment of Incubation program</b>
                                The Bill also provides for accelerator and incubator programmes that will grow the
                                startup ecosystem. The Bill stipulates that national accelerator and incubator policies
                                are to be developed by the Council for the establishment and development of accelerators
                                and incubators. These incubators will help startups solve operations that they are bound
                                to face in running their business, provide workspace at little or no cost, and serve as
                                breeding hubs for the startups.

                            </p>
                            <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
                            <p>The major objective of this Startup Bill is to position the Nigerian tech ecosystem
                                strategically, to enhance and foster digital technology innovation entrepreneurship in
                                Nigeria, and to position Nigeria’s startup ecosystem as the leading digital technology
                                center in Africa. When the Bill receives presidential assent and is passed into law, it
                                will provide an enabling environment for investors, incubators, and accelerators (both
                                local and international), enhance the establishment, development, and operation of
                                startups in Nigeria, and position Nigeria as a hub of excellent innovators with
                                cutting-edge skills and exportable capacity.</p>
